## Generative Models: Digits & Faces

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks exploring generative models, specifically for digit and face generation. The first notebook dives into generating digits using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and the second focuses on face generation using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs).

## Overview

Generative models have gained significant attention in recent years due to their capability to produce new, previously unseen data that resembles a given dataset. This project provides an exploration of such models through practical examples.

## Notebooks
### Digit Generation using VAE

This notebook explores how VAEs can be utilized to generate handwritten digits. It provides a comprehensive walkthrough of building, training, and visualizing the results of a VAE

### Face Generation using DCGANs

In this notebook, DCGANs are employed to generate human faces. The notebook includes steps for designing the network architecture, training the model, and visualizing generated faces.
