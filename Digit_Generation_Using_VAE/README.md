# Digit Generation using VAE and Autoencoders

This notebook provides a deep dive into generative models, specifically focusing on the generation of handwritten digits. We explore two primary architectures: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and traditional autoencoders. Our chosen loss function is a combination of KL divergence and binary crossentropy, providing a balance between generative capability and reconstruction accuracy. Additionally, we delve into the visualization of the latent space to understand the patterns and representations learned by the models.

## Introduction

Generative models are a category of machine learning models that are designed to generate new, previously unseen data. In the realm of handwritten digit generation, this means producing images that resemble digits from the training dataset, but are unique in their own right.

## Model Architectures

### Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

VAEs are probabilistic models that not only learn to encode and decode the input data but also learn a probabilistic mapping to the latent space. This mapping allows VAEs to generate new data points by sampling from the latent space.

### Traditional Autoencoder

Unlike VAEs, traditional autoencoders focus on compressing the input data to a smaller latent representation and then reconstructing the original input from this representation. They don't inherently have a generative capability but can be used to understand data compression and reconstruction.

## Loss Function

Our model is trained using a combined loss function:
- **KL Divergence:** Measures the difference between two probability distributions. In the context of VAEs, it pushes the encoder's outputs to approximate a standard normal distribution, ensuring smoother latent space from which we can sample.
  
- **Binary Crossentropy:** A standard loss function for binary classification tasks, but in the context of autoencoders, it helps in measuring the difference between the original and reconstructed images.

The total loss is a weighted sum of these two components, which allows the model to balance between data reconstruction and effective latent space learning.

## Latent Space Visualization

A pivotal aspect of understanding generative models is to visualize and explore the latent space they learn. In this notebook, we plot and study the latent space, aiming to interpret the clustering of digits and how the models organize information. This visualization provides insights into the patterns and relationships the model has inferred from the data.

## Results & Insights

Our models, equipped with the combined loss function, showcase promising results in both data reconstruction and generation. The VAE, in particular, demonstrates impressive generative capabilities, while the traditional autoencoder provides sharp reconstructions. Detailed visual results and insights are available within the notebook.
